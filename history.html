                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket" target="_blank">Cricket</a> was introduced to Ceylon by the British and the first recorded
                match is dated 1832. The earliest definite mention of cricket in Ceylon
                was a report in the Colombo Journal on 5 September 1832 which called for
                the formation of a cricket club. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombo_Cricket_Club" target="_blank">The Colombo Cricket Club</a>  was formed and
                matches began soon afterwards when it played, on the Rifle Green in Colombo,
                against a team from the 97th Regiment of Foot which was stationed on the island
                from 1825 to 1836.[1][2][3] Through the 19th century, cricket was essentially
                the preserve of European settlers and visitors but it gradually attracted the
                native Ceylonese who were, at first, often needed to make up the numbers.
